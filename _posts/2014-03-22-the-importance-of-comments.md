Much of my coding time these days is spent working on projects that are not completely mine. This is a change from years past when all my code was controlled by me. I would create websites and tools to manage those sitesâ€”mostly right on top of Wordpress.

Now that I have a day job that also involves a heavy amount of coding, most of my time is spent on code that has *nothing* to do with my personal or contract work.

Now that my head is full of things like Ember.js and Grunt (with a touch of ASP), I find that my original work for myself and my personal clients is looking very foreign.

So my newest goal is not to go over all the old stuff and comment the heck out of it, but to *always* comment as I go.

Feel free to welcome me from the depths (well, maybe not the *depths*) of arrogance and stupidity to the world where normal people live.
