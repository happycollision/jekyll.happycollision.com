[Verse (same chords as everything else)]

Bb              Eb        Bb Eb
Standing on the highway on 93
    Bb         Eb             F
I'm missing my home, and it's killing me
Down the ramp passed the jail, I'm feeling alright
Bought roses for my ladies from a corner delight

It's time to get ready for that song and dance
Let's go my friends, it's time to take a chance
We're back in town, we're gonna get it done
We got nowhere to hide, we got nowhere to run

Eb                    F
It's been a long time coming,
Eb                    F
It's been a long time coming,


[Chorus 2 times]


[Interlude]

Bb Eb Bb Eb Bb Eb F


[Verse 2]

If that old familiar city could talk in here
You'd be just another nobody, you'd disappear
Your days are numbered, we're back around
We're coming for you and you're going down

Eb                    F
It's been a long time coming,
Eb                    F
It's been a long time coming,


[Chorus 2 times]


Eb                   F
And we're coming for you
Eb                   F
And we're coming for you


[Chorus 4 times]


[Outro]

    Bb Eb Bb Eb Bb Eb F
For you

Bb Eb Bb Eb Bb Eb F
