I believe that is how the saying goes. Rather than wait to start posting the content I have had in mind, I think now is the best time to do it.

I have had a "Ready, set, go" mindset—as many of us do—for the better part of my adult life. Unfortunately, that mindset tends to lead to procrastination. Maybe not for all of us, but for many. Certainly for me. Time to switch to "Go, set, ready" instead.

This site is an example of that very switch. It is a place for me to connect to the world of technology and software development. Web development work is one of the things that I do, though you might not know it from the look of this site. At the time of this writing, happycollision.com is using the Twenty Thirteen theme right out of the box from WordPress. No need for me to spend time creating some special theme or entire CMS for this site. I have other things to do and other clients to satisfy. But for the first time, I am not going to let my lack of readiness stop me from creating content.

And when you get down to it, Content is King, right?

Happy 2014.
