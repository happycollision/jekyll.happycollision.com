For years now, I have maintained [a trademark for the name Happy Collision
Â®][my-trademark]. This was done not out of an actual need or [out of
vanity][vanity-registration], but out of fear that this name would somehow be
stolen out from underneath me. At this point, it sure does not seem like a good
use of my money, time, and attention. (I sure wish I had realized that back then
that I wouldn't need the registration: paying the fees to the government and the
lawyer I hired was no small thing.)

I doubt that I'll have any cause to fight with someone over the use of the name,
despite allowing the registration with the USPTO to lapse. We shall see.

In the meantime, any clients I attain or currently work with will continue to
communicate with me via my @happycollision email address and will continue to
see the Happy Collision name and logo on any invoices they might require.
