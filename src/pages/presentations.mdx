## Post Playhouse - Logging in to email

In this video, I explain how to log in to an email account to one of the
employees at Post Playhouse. Not glorious, to be sure, but it was meant for
someone who had a hard time logging in and I knew a little visual help would go
a long way.

## Micronews.tv - Angular App Demo

This video was made as part of a job application. It was created so that I could
quickly show the result of some of the front end work I did at Flixpress.

## Flixpress.com - Image Upload Demo

This video was created to help users understand a new feature implemented a

coded the feature that is the topic of this video as well.
